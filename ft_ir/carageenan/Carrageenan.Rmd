Explanation of key steps

Max‐peak extraction (df_peaks): for each sample and each band range, we pull the single highest absorbance.

Arithmetic‐means normalization (df_norm): each band’s peak is divided by the mean of that sample’s peaks, yielding relative intensities around 1.

Index calculation (scores):

Kappa = G4S / DA

Iota = DA2S / DA

Lambda = (G2S + DA2S) / DA

Final tables:

Table3_Intensities: one row per band, showing relative intensities for each sample.

Carrageenan_Scores: per‐sample continuous Kappa, Iota, and Lambda indices.

# Required packages

# 1) Load & reshape your FT-IR data
#    – Excel file where column 1 = Sample name, columns 2… = wavenumbers (numeric)
df_raw <- read_excel("ftir_data.xlsx") %>%
  rename(Sample = 1) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Sample,
    names_to  = "Wavenumber",
    values_to = "Absorbance"
  ) %>%
  mutate(Wavenumber = as.numeric(Wavenumber))

# 2) Define the carrageenan signature bands
bands <- tribble(
  ~code,   ~name,                                   ~lo,   ~hi,
  "S",     "Sulphate ester (O–SO₃⁻)",              1210,  1260,
  "DA",    "C–O band of 3,6-anhydrogalactose",     1070,  1070,
  "DA",    "3,6-anhydro-D-galactose",              928,   933,
  "G4S",   "D-galactose-4-sulphate",               840,   850,
  "G2S",   "D-galactose-2-sulphate",               825,   830,
  "D2S",   "D-galactose-2,6-disulphate",           815,   820,
  "DA2S",  "3,6-anhydro-D-galactose-2-sulphate",   800,   805
)

# 3) Extract max peak intensity in each band & sample
df_peaks <- df_raw %>%
  crossing(bands) %>%
  filter(Wavenumber >= lo, Wavenumber <= hi) %>%
  group_by(Sample, code, name, lo, hi) %>%
  summarize(Peak = max(Absorbance, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# 4) Pivot so each band-code is its own column
df_peak_wide <- df_peaks %>%
  select(Sample, code, Peak) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from  = code,
    values_from = Peak,
    values_fill = 0
  )

# 5) Arithmetic-means normalization of each sample’s peaks
code_cols <- setdiff(names(df_peak_wide), "Sample")
df_norm <- df_peak_wide %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    mean_peak = mean(c_across(all_of(code_cols)), na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(across(
    all_of(code_cols),
    ~ ifelse(mean_peak > 0, .x / mean_peak, 0)
  )) %>%
  select(-mean_peak)

# 6) Compute relative carrageenan scores
scores <- df_norm %>%
  mutate(
    Kappa_Index  = G4S     / DA,
    Iota_Index   = DA2S    / DA,
    Lambda_Index = (G2S + DA2S) / DA
  ) %>%
  select(Sample, Kappa_Index, Iota_Index, Lambda_Index)

# 7) Build “Table 3”–style summary of normalized intensities
table3 <- df_norm %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols       = -Sample,
    names_to   = "Letter_code",
    values_to  = "Rel_Intensity"
  ) %>%
  left_join(bands, by = c("Letter_code" = "code")) %>%
  mutate(
    `Wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)` = paste0(lo, "–", hi),
    `Functional group`   = name
  ) %>%
  select(`Wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)`, `Functional group`, Letter_code,
         Sample, Rel_Intensity) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from  = Sample,
    values_from = Rel_Intensity
  ) %>%
  arrange(lo) %>%
  select(-lo, -hi, -name)

# 8) Write outputs to Excel
write_xlsx(
  list(
    Table3_Intensities = table3,
    Carrageenan_Scores  = scores
  ),
  path = "ftir_summary.xlsx"
)

# 9) Print to console
cat("\n=== Table 3 — Normalized Band Intensities ===\n")
print(table3)

cat("\n=== Carrageenan Relative Scores ===\n")
print(scores)
